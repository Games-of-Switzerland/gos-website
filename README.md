# Swiss Games Garden

The list of Swiss video games is, although you might think it is not, massive. This website is here to make the most exhaustive list of all the creations from our country. It is mainly intended for journalists, searchers and all the people in the game development world. It can also be used at your discretion to shut up people saying "we don't make video games in Switzerland, you suck". Those degenerates.
